# NAS_RNN_Submission
Case setup for "Recurrent Neural Network Architecture Search for Geophysical Emulation" - Submission to ISC 2020. 

In the following - we shall outline how to install DeepHyper on your local machine to assess a trial evaluation for LSTM architecture search.

# Installation instructions

# Incorporating this problem

# Checking for random architectures

# Initializing a new neural architecture search serially
